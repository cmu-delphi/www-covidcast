- Time series plots now include shaded regions showing the standard error of the signal estimates, when available.
- New map: The “Deaths (JHU)” map shows death ratios (deaths per 100,000 population) due to COVID-19 per day. This reflects official figures from state and local health authorities, [as compiled by a team at Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/).
- New map: The “Confirmed Cases (JHU)” map shows confirmed case ratios (cases per 100,000 population) of COVID-19 per day. This reflects official figures reporting cases confirmed by testing to be COVID-19, [as compiled by a team at Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/).
- The “Flu Testing (Quidel)” map is no longer shown. During flu season, rates of flu tests may have correlated with rates of COVID-like illnesses, as many doctors who suspected COVID-19 conducted flu tests to rule out influenza. However, the end of flu season means few flu tests are currently conducted.
- Previously, the “Search Trends (Google)” signal reported search volume on each day on the map for the following day; for example, search volume on April 16 would be mapped as occurring on April 17. This is no longer done.
