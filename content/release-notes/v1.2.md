- New map: The “Combined” signal represents a statistical combination of the other indicators, not including the official reports (cases and deaths). For more information how this indicator is calculated, see the details above in the list of indicators.
- New map: The “Symptoms in Community (Facebook)” map shows the estimated fraction of people who know someone with a COVID-like illness in their local community. 
- The “Surveys (Facebook)” map has been renamed “Symptoms (Facebook)”, to reflect that it asks respondents whether people in their household have COVID-like symptoms.
