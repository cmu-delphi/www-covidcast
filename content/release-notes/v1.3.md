- The COVIDcast map now includes Puerto Rico. Not all data sources are available for Puerto Rico, but data will be displayed when available.
- The “Combined” signal now includes standard error bands when viewing the time series plot for a specific geographical area, representing the estimated uncertainty in this signal. This uncertainty comes because the signal is a combination of the other signals which are based on survey estimates or other estimates with margins of error. Details on how the standard error bands are calculated will be made available in the detailed methodology document [linked above]({{<ref methodology >}}).
- Tooltips for the official Cases and Deaths signals have been updated to contain the population, raw count, and count per 100,000 people, to help distinguish sparsely-populated areas with one or two cases from dense urban areas with more total cases but an apparently lower rate per 100,000 people.
- Fixed a bug that inflated the color value for per capita Cases and Deaths relative to the legend.
- Other small bug fixes and improvements in the COVIDcast map.
