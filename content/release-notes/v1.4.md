- Map controls have been revised to more easily select indicators and geographic areas.
- A new search bar makes it possible to quickly find any county or city of interest.
- The color scale for increasing and decreasing 7-day trends has been updated to more clearly highlight trends.
- New maps: The “Away from home” maps use mobile device location data from SafeGraph to estimate the proportion of people spending time outside their homes each day, for either 3-6 hours or more than 6 hours.
- Map color scales on the cases and deaths maps are now logarithmic, making it easier to see differences among regions with both low rates and high rates.
- Cases and deaths maps are now based on 7-day averages, rather than reporting figures for a single day.
