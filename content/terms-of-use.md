Version Date: May 18, 2020

### Introduction/Scope

The Carnegie Mellon University (“CMU”) COVIDcast [website](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) (“Site”) displays signals related to COVID-19 activity levels across the United States, derived from a variety of anonymized, aggregated data sources made available by multiple partners.

Each signal may reflect the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, mild symptoms, or more severe disease over time. Each signal can be presented at multiple geographic resolutions: state, county, and/or metropolitan area. All these signals taken together may suggest heightened or rising COVID-19 activity in specific locations.

**THE COVID-19 INDICATORS VISUALIZED ON OUR MAP ARE RESEARCH RESULTS AND PROJECTIONS DERIVED FROM VARIOUS DATA SOURCES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON AN-AS, AS-AVAILABLE BASIS AS MORE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED IN THESE TERMS OF USE, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR DIAGNOSTIC OR TREATMENT PURPOSES, OR FOR GUIDANCE ON ANY TYPE OF TRAVEL.**

Your use of the Site constitutes your agreement to these Terms of Use (**“TOU”**).
