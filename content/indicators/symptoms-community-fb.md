This indicator estimates the percentage of people who _know someone in their community_ with a COVID-like illness (fever, along with cough, or shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing). The data is based on the same [CMU-run survey]({{<ref "surveys" >}}), advertised by Facebook, as is used for the Symptoms indicator. Note that more people tend to report knowing someone in their community with a COVID-like illness than having someone in their own household with a COVID-like illness, so these numbers are higher than the household symptoms survey.
