These indicators estimate the proportion of people who spend time outside their homes during daytime hours, using mobile device location data provided by SafeGraph. “Away from Home 6hr+” is the proportion spending more than 6 hours outside their home, while “Away from Home 3-6hr” is the proportion spending between 3 and 6 hours outside their home. These estimates may be related to the spread of COVID-19, since they are related to the number of people interacting with others outside their homes, and also reveal the impact of the pandemic and movement restrictions.
