(Archived) This indicator is based on data about influenza lab tests provided to us by Quidel, Inc., a company that makes equipment and kits for medical tests.  When a patient (whether at a doctorâ€™s office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like symptoms, standard practice currently is to perform a conventional influenza test to rule out seasonal influenza (flu), because these two diseases have similar symptoms. While the number of COVID tests performed depends on local capacity and testing policy, influenza testing is not influenced by these factors.  Because a different number of labs may report on different days, we track the average number of flu tests performed per flu testing device (in a given location and on a given day).
