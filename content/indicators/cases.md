These indicators show the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per day. The maps reflect only cases confirmed by state and local health authorities. They are based on confirmed case counts compiled and made public by [a team at Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) and by [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/). We use Johns Hopkins data for Puerto Rico and report USAFacts data in all other locations.
