This indicator estimates the percentage of COVID-19 antigen tests that come back positive, based on testing data provided to us by Quidel, Inc., a company that makes equipment and kits for medical tests. When a patient (whether at a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like symptoms, doctors may order an antigen test. An antigen test can detect parts of the virus that are present during an active infection. Note that this data may differ from testing figures reported by state and local health authorities, as it only includes Quidel’s COVID-19 antigen tests, not those from other testing providers.
