This indicator estimates the percentage of people who have a COVID-like illness (fever, along with cough, or shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing), based on [symptom surveys run by Carnegie Mellon]({{<ref "surveys" >}}). The surveys ask respondents how many people in their household are experiencing COVID-like symptoms, among other questions. Facebook directs a random sample of its users to these surveys, which are voluntary. Individual survey responses are held by CMU and are shareable with other health researchers under a data use agreement. No individual survey responses are shared back to Facebook. As of mid-June, about 70,000 such surveys were completed daily throughout the U.S.
