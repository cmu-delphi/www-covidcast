These indicators shows the number of COVID-19 related deaths per day. The maps reflect official figures by state and local health authorities, and may not include excess deaths not confirmed as due to COVID-19 by health authorities. They are based on confirmed death counts compiled and made public by [a team at Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) and by [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/). We use Johns Hopkins data for Puerto Rico and report USAFacts data in all other locations.
