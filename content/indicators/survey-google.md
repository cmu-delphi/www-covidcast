(Paused) This indicator estimates the percentage of people who _know someone in their community_ with a COVID-like illness (fever, along with cough, or shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing). The data is based on Google-run symptom surveys, through publisher websites, Google's Opinions Reward app, and similar applications. These surveys are voluntary. As of mid April, about 600,000 people answered the survey daily throughout the U.S. Note that these Google surveys are estimating a different quantity than the surveys given to Facebook users (percentage of people who _know someone in their community_ who is sick, rather than percentage of people who are sick), so the estimates from the Google surveys tend to be larger.
