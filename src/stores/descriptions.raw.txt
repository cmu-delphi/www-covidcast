MapTitleText: 7-day trailing average of fraction of people spending 6 hours or more between 8am-6pm, in one location away from their home, based on SafeGraph mobility data


Description: Delphi receives data from [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/social-distancing-metrics), which collects anonymized location data from mobile phones. Using this data, we calculate the fraction of mobile devices that spent more than 6 hours in one location other than their home during the daytime, and average it over a 7 day trailing window. This indicator measures how mobile people are, and ought to reflect whether people are traveling to work or school outside their homes. See also our "At Away Location 3-6hr" indicator.

We select locations that qualify as "Drinking Places (alcoholic beverages)" from all the [core places](https://docs.safegraph.com/v4.0/docs/places-manual#section-core-places), then count the number of visits and normalize by population size. Note that these counts only include people whose visits are tracked because they are in SafeGraph’s panel; they do not include all bar visits by everyone in the population.

MapTitleText: Percentage of people who say they wear a mask most or all of the time while in public, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask them if they wear a mask when they are in public. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people who say they wear a mask most or all of the time when they are in public.

Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they would choose to be vaccinated if they were offered a COVID vaccine today. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people who would “definitely” or “probably” choose to be vaccinated if a COVID vaccine were offered to them. Beginning January 6, 2021, this question is only asked to respondents who have not yet received a COVID vaccine.

MapTitleText: Percentage of daily doctor visits that are due to COVID-like symptoms


Description: Delphi receives from our health system partners aggregated statistics on COVID-related outpatient doctor visits, derived from ICD codes found in insurance claims. Using this data Delphi estimates the percentage of daily doctor’s visits in each area that are due to COVID-like illness. Note that these estimates are based only on visits by patients whose data is accessible to our partners.

MapTitleText: Percentage of people with COVID-like symptoms, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask questions about well-being and various mitigation measures, including mask wearing. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people self-reporting COVID-like symptoms, defined here as fever along with either cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing. While many other conditions can cause these symptoms, comparing the rates of COVID-like symptoms across the country can suggest where COVID is most active.

Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask them if they know anyone in their local community who has COVID-like or flu-like symptoms, defined here as fever along with either sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.  For this indicator, we estimate the percentage of people who know someone, in their household or outside it, who has these symptoms. While many conditions can cause these symptoms, not just COVID, comparing the rates across the country can suggest where COVID is most active.

MapTitleText: 'Combination of several COVID-19 indicators: Doctor Visits, Symptoms, Symptoms in Community, and Search on Google'


Description: This data represents a combination of Doctor Visits, COVID-Like Symptoms (from the Delphi survey), COVID-Like Symptoms in Community (from the Delphi survey), and COVID Search on Google.  It does not include official reports (cases and deaths), hospital admissions, or SafeGraph signals.  We use a rank-1 approximation from a nonnegative matrix factorization approach to identify a single underlying signal that best reconstructs the indicators.  Higher values of the combined signal correspond to higher values of the other indicators, but the scale (units) of the combination is arbitrary.

MapTitleText: Positivity rate of COVID-19 antigen tests


Description: When a patient (whether at a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like symptoms, doctors may order an antigen test, which can detect parts of the virus that are present during an active infection. Quidel, a national provider of networked lab testing devices, provides us with data from every COVID antigen test that they conduct. We report the percentage of COVID antigen tests that are positive. Note that this signal only includes Quidel’s antigen tests, not those run by other test providers.

Using this data, we estimate the percentage of new hospital admissions each day that are related to COVID-19. Note that these estimates are based only on admissions by patients whose data is accessible to our partners,  and address new hospital admissions each day, not all currently hospitalized patients who have COVID-related diagnoses.
