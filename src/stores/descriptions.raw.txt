Name: Bar Visits
Id: safegraph-weekly
Signal: bars_visit_prop


SignalTooltip: Daily number of visits to bars per 100,000 people, based on SafeGraph’s Weekly Patterns dataset

Description: Delphi receives data from [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns), which collects weekly insights on Points of Interest (POI) using anonymized location data from mobile phones. We select locations that qualify as "Drinking Places (alcoholic beverages)" from all the [core places](https://docs.safegraph.com/v4.0/docs/places-manual#section-core-places), then count the number of visits and normalize by population size. Note that these counts only include people whose visits are tracked because they are in SafeGraph’s panel; they do not include all bar visits by everyone in the population.

SignalTooltip: Daily number of visits to restaurants per 100,000 people, based on SafeGraph’s Weekly Patterns dataset

Description: Delphi receives data from [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns), which collects weekly insights on Points of Interest (POI) using anonymized location data from mobile phones. We select locations that qualify as "Full-Service Restaurants" from all the [core places]( https://docs.safegraph.com/v4.0/docs/places-manual#section-core-places), then count the number of visits and normalize by population size. Note that these counts only include people whose visits are tracked because they are in SafeGraph’s panel; they do not include all restaurant visits by everyone in the population.

Name: People Wearing Masks
Id: fb-survey
Signal: smoothed_wwearing_mask_7d
LinkFrom: [fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask_7d, fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask_5d]
Highlight: [landing]


SignalTooltip: Percentage of people who say they wear a mask most or all of the time while in public, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask them if they wear a mask when they are in public. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people who say they wear a mask most or all of the time when they are in public. The signal changed in [Wave 10](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/coding.html#wave-10) of the survey, unifying the timespan to 7 days from previously 5 days.

LinkFrom: [fb-survey-smoothed_covid_vaccinated_or_accept]
Highlight: [landing, location]


SignalTooltip: Percentage of people who either have already received a COVID vaccine, have an appointment to receive a COVID vaccine, or would definitely or probably choose to receive one if it were offered to them today, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they have received a COVID vaccine, have an appointment to do so, or would choose to be vaccinated if they were offered a COVID vaccine today. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people who either (a) say they have already received a COVID vaccine, (b) have an appointment to receive a COVID vaccine, or (c) would “definitely” or “probably” choose to be vaccinated if a COVID vaccine were offered to them today. The signal changed in [Wave 11](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/coding.html#wave-11) of the survey, asking all non-vaccinated respondents if they have an appointment to be vaccinated and treating those with appointments as vaccine-accepting.

Name: COVID Symptom Searches on Google
Id: google-symptoms
Signal: sum_anosmia_ageusia_smoothed_search
Unit: scaled search volume

SignalTooltip: Google search volume of COVID-related symptom searches

Description: Using Google Symptoms Searches, Delphi obtains the sum of Google search volumes for anosmia (loss of smell) related searches and ageusia (loss of taste) related searches in each area, since they emerged as unusual symptoms that are indicative of COVID-19. Note that the sum of two symptom search volumes is not equivalent to the union of anosmia and ageusia related searches. According to Google, the estimates are not comparable across regions since the values are normalized by population and scaled by region-specific maximum popularity at a particular time point.

Name: COVID-Related Doctor Visits
Id: doctor-visits
Signal: smoothed_adj_cli
Unit: per 100 visits
Highlight: [landing, default]


SignalTooltip: Percentage of daily doctor visits that are due to COVID-like symptoms


Description: Delphi receives from our health system partners aggregated statistics on COVID-related outpatient doctor visits, derived from ICD codes found in insurance claims. Using this data Delphi estimates the percentage of daily doctor’s visits in each area that are due to COVID-like illness. Note that these estimates are based only on visits by patients whose data is accessible to our partners.

Name: COVID-Like Symptoms
Id: fb-survey
Signal: smoothed_wcli
Unit: per 100 people


SignalTooltip: Percentage of people with COVID-like symptoms, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask questions about well-being and various mitigation measures, including mask wearing. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people self-reporting COVID-like symptoms, defined here as fever along with either cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing. While many other conditions can cause these symptoms, comparing the rates of COVID-like symptoms across the country can suggest where COVID is most active.

Name: COVID-Like Symptoms in Community
Id: fb-survey
Signal: smoothed_whh_cmnty_cli
Unit: per 100 people
Highlight: [landing, location]


SignalTooltip: Percentage of people who know someone in their local community with COVID-like symptoms, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask them if they know anyone in their local community who has COVID-like or flu-like symptoms, defined here as fever along with either sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.  For this indicator, we estimate the percentage of people who know someone, in their household or outside it, who has these symptoms. While many conditions can cause these symptoms, not just COVID, comparing the rates across the country can suggest where COVID is most active.

Name: COVID Antigen Test Positivity (Quidel)
Id: quidel-covid-ag
Signal: covid_ag_smoothed_pct_positive
Unit: per 100 tests
Highlight: [landing]


SignalTooltip: Positivity rate of COVID-19 antigen tests, based on data provided by Quidel, Inc.


Description: When a patient (whether at a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like symptoms, doctors may order an antigen test, which can detect parts of the virus that are present during an active infection. Quidel, a national provider of networked lab testing devices, provides us with data from every COVID antigen test that they conduct. We report the percentage of COVID antigen tests that are positive. Note that this signal only includes Quidel’s antigen tests, not those run by other test providers.

Name: Claims-Based COVID Hospital Admissions
Id: hospital-admissions
Signal: smoothed_adj_covid19_from_claims
Unit: per 100 admissions
Highlight: [landing]


SignalTooltip: Percentage of daily hospital admissions with COVID-19 associated diagnoses


Description: Delphi receives from our health system partners aggregated statistics on COVID-related hospital admissions, derived from ICD codes found in insurance claims.  Using this data, we estimate the percentage of new hospital admissions each day that are related to COVID-19. Note that these estimates are based only on admissions by patients whose data is accessible to our partners, and address new hospital admissions each day, not all currently hospitalized patients who have COVID-related diagnoses.

SignalTooltip: Newly reported COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people, based on data from Johns Hopkins University


Description: This data shows the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases newly reported each day. It  reflects only cases reported by state and local health authorities. It is based on case counts compiled and made public by [a team at Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/). The signal may not be directly comparable across regions with vastly different testing capacity or reporting criteria.
