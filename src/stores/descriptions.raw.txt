Name: People Wearing Masks
Id: fb-survey
Signal: smoothed_wwearing_mask_7d
LinkFrom: [fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask_7d, fb-survey-smoothed_wearing_mask_5d]


SignalTooltip: Percentage of people who say they wear a mask most or all of the time while in public, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask them if they wear a mask when they are in public. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people who say they wear a mask most or all of the time when they are in public. The signal changed in [Wave 10](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/coding.html#wave-10) of the survey, unifying the timespan to 7 days from previously 5 days.

Id: fb-survey
Signal: smoothed_wcovid_vaccinated_appointment_or_accept
LinkFrom: [fb-survey-smoothed_covid_vaccinated_or_accept]
SignalTooltip: Percentage of people who either have already received a COVID vaccine, have an appointment to receive a COVID vaccine, or would definitely or probably choose to receive one if it were offered to them today, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they have received a COVID vaccine, have an appointment to do so, or would choose to be vaccinated if they were offered a COVID vaccine today. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people who either (a) say they have already received a COVID vaccine, (b) have an appointment to receive a COVID vaccine, or (c) would “definitely” or “probably” choose to be vaccinated if a COVID vaccine were offered to them today. The signal changed in [Wave 11](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/coding.html#wave-11) of the survey, asking all non-vaccinated respondents if they have an appointment to be vaccinated and treating those with appointments as vaccine-accepting.

Name: Symptom Searches (Smell and Taste) on Google 
Id: google-symptoms
Signal: s05_smoothed_search
Unit: scaled search volume
UnitShort: 
noMaps: true
 
SignalTooltip: Google search volume of COVID-related symptom searches about smell and taste
 
Description: Using Google Symptoms Searches, Delphi obtains the average of Google search volumes for searches related to anosmia (loss of smell), ageusia (loss of taste), and dysgeusia (altered or impaired taste) in each area, since they emerged as unusual symptoms that can be indicative of COVID-19. Note that the average of the three symptom search volumes is not equivalent to the search volume of their union. According to Google, the estimates are not comparable across regions since the values are normalized by population and scaled by region-specific maximum popularity (and for this reason, we omit beehive grids and choropleth maps of this signal on the dashboard).

Name: Symptom Searches (Common Cold) on Google 
Id: google-symptoms
Signal: s02_smoothed_search
Unit: scaled search volume
UnitShort: 
noMaps: true
 
SignalTooltip: Google search volume of COVID-related symptom searches about common cold
 
Description: Using Google Symptoms Searches, Delphi obtains the average of Google search volumes for searches related to nasal congestion, post nasal drip, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, rhinitis, and common cold in each area. These symptoms have showed positive correlation with reported COVID cases, especially since Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization. Note that the average search volume of these symptoms is not equivalent to the search volume of their union. According to Google, the estimates are not comparable across regions since the values are normalized by population and scaled by region-specific maximum popularity (and for this reason, we omit beehive grids and choropleth maps of this signal on the dashboard).

Name: COVID-Like Symptoms
Id: fb-survey
Signal: smoothed_wcli
Unit: per 100 people


SignalTooltip: Percentage of people with COVID-like symptoms, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask questions about well-being and various mitigation measures, including mask wearing. For this signal, we estimate the percentage of people self-reporting COVID-like symptoms, defined here as fever along with either cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing. While many other conditions can cause these symptoms, comparing the rates of COVID-like symptoms across the country can suggest where COVID is most active.

Name: COVID-Like Symptoms in Community
Id: fb-survey
Signal: smoothed_whh_cmnty_cli
Unit: per 100 people


SignalTooltip: Percentage of people who know someone in their local community with COVID-like symptoms, based on surveys of Facebook users


Description: Every day, Delphi surveys tens of thousands of Facebook users, asking them a broad set of COVID-related questions, including whether they, or anyone in their household, are currently experiencing COVID-related symptoms. We also ask them if they know anyone in their local community who has COVID-like or flu-like symptoms, defined here as fever along with either sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.  For this indicator, we estimate the percentage of people who know someone, in their household or outside it, who has these symptoms. While many conditions can cause these symptoms, not just COVID, comparing the rates across the country can suggest where COVID is most active.

Name: COVID-Related Doctor Visits
Id: doctor-visits
Signal: smoothed_adj_cli
Unit: per 100 visits


SignalTooltip: Percentage of daily doctor visits that are due to COVID-like symptoms


Description: Delphi receives from our health system partners aggregated statistics on COVID-related outpatient doctor visits, derived from ICD codes found in insurance claims. Using this data Delphi estimates the percentage of daily doctor’s visits in each area that are due to COVID-like illness. Note that these estimates are based only on visits by patients whose data is accessible to our partners.

Name: COVID Antigen Test Positivity
Id: quidel-covid-ag
Signal: covid_ag_smoothed_pct_positive
Unit: per 100 tests


SignalTooltip: Positivity rate of COVID-19 antigen tests, based on data provided by Quidel, Inc.


Description: When a patient (whether at a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital) has COVID-like symptoms, doctors may order an antigen test, which can detect parts of the virus that are present during an active infection. Quidel, a national provider of networked lab testing devices, provides us with data from every COVID antigen test that they conduct. We report the percentage of COVID antigen tests that are positive. Note that this signal only includes Quidel’s antigen tests, not those run by other test providers.

SignalTooltip: Newly reported COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people, based on data from Johns Hopkins University


Description: This data shows the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases newly reported each day. It  reflects only cases reported by state and local health authorities. It is based on case counts compiled and made public by [a team at Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/). The signal may not be directly comparable across regions with vastly different testing capacity or reporting criteria.
